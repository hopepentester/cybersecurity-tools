# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Tools
A collection of simple but effective cybersecurity tools developed during my internship at Hack Secure (April–May 2025). These tools were built to demonstrate fundamental concepts in ethical hacking and information security, focusing on reconnaissance, password security, and network defense.

**Environment:**  
These tools were developed and tested in a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM). Some commands or libraries may require a similar Linux environment to work properly.
